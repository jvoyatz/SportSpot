The application is an upcoming sport events viewer which allows users to check sport events about to start in the near future.

## Basic stuff

+ Endpoint: 
  [https://618d3aa7fe09aa001744060a.mockapi.io/api/sports] (https://618d3aa7fe09aa001744060a.mockapi.io/api/sports)
+ Functionalities:
  1. Events should scroll horizontally, each row representing a different sport.
  2. Users should be allowed to mark an event as a favourite and favourites should
    appear first in their respective row. You do not need to persist them after the
    application is killed, marking them volatilely as favourites for a single run is enough.
  3. Each event must display a countdown to its starting time.
  4. Users should be able to collapse and expand events per sport.
+ MinSDK: 21
